# genomap-annotation

This repository mainly contains code files which contain the execution of code for conversion of csv files to genomaps. The primary dataset used was TM_data.csv. The data was converted into genomaps and these genomaps were annotated as different cell types based on the pixel identification using feature extraction.

The process was carried out using the ADNI dataset which was converted to genomaps but annotating them was a highly computational task and will be completed in future.
